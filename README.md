# Dynamical modeling of miR-34a, miR-449a, and miR-16 reveals numerous DDR signaling pathways regulating senescence, autophagy, and apoptosis in HeLa cells
GINsim 3.0.0b was used for the construction and simulation of the Boolean model and visualization of the results which is a Java-based software and is freely available to researchers (http://www.ginsim.org/downloads) 
Code of the model used for GINsim 3.0.0b are availabe here:
1. In .zginml format which can be directly opened in GINsim software.
2. In .xhtml format where the file can be opened using any browser e.g. Google Chrome. (Also download the folder as well)
3. In .xgmml format which can be opened using Cytoscape.
